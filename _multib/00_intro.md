#### Ph.D. thesis
- Chiara Rizzi's Ph.D. thesis, ["Searches for supersymmetric particles in finalstates with multiple top and bottom quarks with theATLAS detector"](https://cernbox.cern.ch/index.php/s/Vk8rEcs33Mf6zpC). Ph.D. dissertation covering the strong-production multi-b analysis (Gtt and Gbb models) and the electroweak multi-b analysis (higgsino pair production). For the latter, the focus is on the MET-based analysis.
- Giordon Stark's Ph.D. thesis, ["The search for supersymmetry in hadronic final states using boosted object reconstruction"](https://cds.cern.ch/record/2317296?ln=en). Ph.D. dissertation covering boosted objects and their application to the Gtt signal for the strong-production multi-b analysis.
