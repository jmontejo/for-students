[ROOT](https://root.cern/) is a software framework for data analysis widely used in ATLAS and at CERN in general.


## Tutorials and references

- The [ROOT primer](https://root.cern/primer/) is a very good tutorial, that starts from zero and walks you through
all the most important ROOT functionalities. It is also a good reference to look at in case of basic questions. If this is your first experience with ROOT, the ROOT primer is a great starting point. 
- Each ROOT class has its own class reference page. E.g. [this](https://root.cern.ch/doc/master/classTTree.html)
is the page for TTree. Here you can find examples and documentation for all the related functions. 
- [pyROOT](https://root.cern/manual/python/) is ROOT's Python-C++ bindings, and it allows to use ROOT from python.
It is very useful to quickly produce plots! Here you can find examples and tutorials. 

## Additional information 

- The [ATLAS software tutorial](https://atlassoftwaredocs.web.cern.ch/ABtutorial/) covers much more advanced topics,
to show you how ROOT is used in complex analyses setups.
