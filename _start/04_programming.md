## Python
- [Google's Python Class](https://developers.google.com/edu/python) is a free python course, targeting
people with no knowledge of python but who have programmed in other languages before 

## Machine learning
- Andrew Ng's [Machine Learning course on coursera] is a great startin point.
It's a very clear course, that doesn't dive too deep into the mathematical aspects but
covers all the basics that you need.
    - If you liked the course above, you might want to take a look at the notes from other people who have followed it, e.g.: the blog entry
    on [Deep Learning Specialization by Andrew Ng — 21 Lessons Learned](https://towardsdatascience.com/deep-learning-specialization-by-andrew-ng-21-lessons-learned-15ffaaef627c) from Ryan Shrott. 
- The slides and lecture notes of the [CS229: Machine Learning](http://cs229.stanford.edu/syllabus.html) course from Stanford
(Moses Charikar and Chris Ré) also provide a very good introductory material.
