## Python
- [Google's Python Class](https://developers.google.com/edu/python) is a free python course, targeting
people with no knowledge of python but who have programmed in other languages before 

## C++
- If you already know the basics of C++, and are looking for information on a
specific aspect, or how to use a specific library or function, [cppreference.com](https://en.cppreference.com/w/)
is a good starting point for your research. E.g., if you don't remember how to add elements to a vector,
you can find examples in the page dedicated to [std::vector::push_back](https://www.cplusplus.com/reference/vector/vector/push_back/)
(reachable through the general [std::vector](https://www.cplusplus.com/reference/vector/vector/) page. 

## Machine learning
- Andrew Ng's [Machine Learning course on coursera](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning?action=enroll&adgroupid=73238990061&adpostion=&campaignid=2070742271&creativeid=369041663030&device=c&devicemodel=&gclid=CjwKCAjwr_uCBhAFEiwAX8YJgcnfbTxzxscODBuNMYrk_AFd0iXpopLtMOigVr5omWNp2CbvlZotLhoCJdwQAvD_BwE&hide_mobile_promo&keyword=ai+machine+learning+tutorial&matchtype=b&network=g&utm_campaign=07-StanfordML-ROW&utm_content=07-StanfordML-ROW&utm_medium=sem&utm_source=gg)
is a great starting point. 
It's a very clear course, that doesn't dive too deep into the mathematical aspects but
covers all the basics that you need.
- The slides and lecture notes of the [CS229: Machine Learning](http://cs229.stanford.edu/syllabus.html) course from Stanford
(Moses Charikar and Chris Ré) also provide a very good introductory material.
